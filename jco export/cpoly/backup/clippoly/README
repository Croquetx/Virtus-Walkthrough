If you don't have g++, but a cfront based compiler like Sun C++ 3.0, thenyou should compile the files from the CC subdirectory to this directory.The String.{cc,h} files are not a complete implementation of a String class;they only provide what is used in the file poly_io.cc. For a good Stringclass you can try the libg++ library (which I assume is installed if youhave g++.)Also, rename Makefile.CC to Makefile. If you don't have g++ nor a cfrontbased compiler then you are on your own.Compilers which are know to work:g++ 2.4 -> 2.6.0 g++ 2.6.1 has a bug in constructor sysntax which break thiscode.Sun C++ 2.1, 3, 4Irix CC on Irix 5.2A bug which reveals itself on Ultrix mips machines is known. The fix willbe incorporated in this code some day.Before compiling, skim through the Makefile. Three differences can be made:- Changing the C compiler. Standard is cc. gcc -traditional can be used on  systems with proper header files (this excludes SunOS 4.1.X). Ansi C  compilers give warnings on the C files, as they are in K&R C, and the  header files are ANSI C / C++.- Adding the notion of a .cc file as a C++ source file. Some make's (like  SGI's) do not standard recognize a .cc file as C++- Patching libg++. Early versions of libg++ 2.5 (notably, 2.5.1 and 2.5.2)  suffered a bug which caused the test porgram to hang. If you add  sbscan.cc to the program (replacing the one in libg++) this bug is fixed.  Better off course is to upgrade to a more recent libg++!  Note that libg++ 2.4.X does not have this bug, and can be used without  (known) problems.In this directory you can find the test program for the ncliplibrary. In this directory is:lgpl.texinfo: texinfo style version of the copyright statement.test.cc: The wrapper in which we can test. Reads two clockwise	oriented polygons from stdin, and clips those. Results	comes on stdout. Examples format for input can be found in	in_file.nclip.cc:	The actual clip routine. Only file in the nclip	library which is decent documented.nclip.h nclip.cc poly.cc poly.h poly_io.cc poly_io.h posadder.cc posadder.hprimitives.cc primitives.h set.h:	The rest of the nclip library. Not of real interest, but needed to	get nclip running.sbscan.cc:	Part of libg++. It is a patched version of a file from libg++ 2.5.1err.* graph*:	files, part of our standard , in-house library. Not likely to	have big errors. They even come with documentation!	(*.3, nroff (== UNIX man) format)	They should be compiled with a K&R C compiler (like gcc -traditional.)CLASSES:	Some documentation about the classes used.
