ConstPolyIter:	A PolyIter which is constructed of a const Poly.DirPolyIter:	Provides an iterator for a Poly which can go forward and backwards.Edge:	A side of a polygon consisting of two Point's. I'm afraid this one	is no longer used.NodePEdge:	Represents an edge from a Poly.Point:	A 2-D point. Some arithmetic operations are overloaded.PointList:	List of Point's. I'm afraid that this one is no longer used.PointListIter:	An iterator for a PointList.Poly:	A polygon. Consist of a double linked list of PolyNode's.PolyIter:	Provides an iterator over a Poly.PolyNode:	A single point in a Poly.PosAdder:	A 'boolean' which can have the values UnKnown, True and False.Set:	A template implementation of a Set. Main design issue: fast to	implement :-)SetIter:	Iterator for a Set.RSet, RSetIter: 	Similar to the Set classes, but handle data by reference.
