Virtus Online Phase 1 Plan (priority order)=------------------------=Drew DavidsonGeneral	All of following code can be compiled in with #define VRML_EXPORT 1	(Possibly include multiple tags?  e.g.		#define VRML_TCP_PUT 1		#define VRML_URL_TAGS 1   )1) URL tag on objects	- Add "URL tag..." menu item in some menu (probably Design menu)	- Make dialog box for user to type or paste in the URL for object	- Save URL in model with object (extend file format)		Done:	~~~~~	added menu item to design menu, surface menu	added GetVRMLAnchor/SetVRMLAnchor/HasVRMLAnchor routines to Polyhedron, 		SurfDef, and SurfFeature, also added anchor instance variable	added IO_VRAN routines to Polyhedron, SurfDef, and SurfFeature for saving	make VRML Anchor menu item dim/enable properly (i.e. if exactly one 		object is selected -- either 1 poly, 1 surface, or 1 surffeature)	make anchor URL dialog show up, let user type in text, hit OK etc.	create/delete VRML anchor instance variables (VArrays)	make anchor URL dialog wider for long URL's	make dialog show current anchor (if there is one) for editing	make anchor dialog change the object instance variables	make anchors save with model		To Do:	~~~~~~	testing	make anchor URL dialog accept copy/paste commands		-- dialog currently is totally nonstandard -- blocks out all menus		   including app menu, help menu, edit menu, everything!!!! 		   (another bug: insertion point doesn't blink if cursor not inside		   the window)	possibly check URL's for invalid char's and conver to canonical form???2) Dialog box for VRML export options (similar to other export dialogs;	not a preferences page but rather a simple dialog)	- Two sided polygons	- Surface feature z-offset amount	- New line or CR-LF for line termination	- hook this stuff into preferences file so options are saved and are	  accessible 	Done:	~~~~~	make VRML export menu item		-- add to menu, make preempt code, make action code	make export dialog show up	make actual controls in export dialog		check box: Two sided polygons		edit text: Surface feature z-offset amount		check box: New line or CR-LF for line termination	make preferences items for VRML export prefs	make dialog use current prefs as default values (SetOptions)	make dialog set prefs when user changes dialog values (GetResults)		To Do:	~~~~~~	make dialog look nice	make VRML KeyPos and EuroKey, whatever that is	testing3) HTTP PUT/FTP PUT/Script Saving	- Add preference page (or should be a dialog like export options?)	- Add "Save Remotely" menu item in File menu			- TCP / HTTP / FTP internal code		- Incorporate current Mac code into codebase		- Make Windows version of code		- Tie into user interface	Recommendations:  If deadline is approaching, bag the TCP / HTTP / FTP PUT codebecause that is not yet done for Windows and may take a while to implement andtest.  Also, it is definitely the least needed feature (since users can justuse standard tools like Fetch to handle this -- it is not required that wedo it).  The URL tag on objects IMHO should be fully implemented before workis done on TCP / HTTP / FTP PUT.
