Davidson	April 1995		This code uses ADSP to do network communication.  		More info on AppleTalk networking can be found in:		"Inside Macintosh: Networking"  (aka IM-Networking)		Chapter 1: Introduction to AppleTalk			especially page 1-24 for ADSP info		Chapter 5: AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP)			especially pages 5-13 through 5-17, and 5-43 through 5-76		Chapter 3: Name-Binding Protocol (NBP)			This protocol (ADSP) has many advantages.  ADSP is high-level, network-independent,	full-duplex, supports attention messages outside the main data stream, provides	error checking and reliable, proper-sequence delivery of data.  ADSP also provides	for a sub-protocol ASDSP, which allows secure connections but is not implemented	here.			From IM-Networking, page 1-24:			Your application can use ADSP to set up and maintain a connection with 			another application over an internet. Through this connection, both 			applications can send and receive streams of data at any time. Because 			ADSP allows for the continuous exchange of data, any application that 			needs to support the exchange of more than a small amount of data should 			use ADSP. In addition to providing for a duplex data stream, ADSP also 			provides an application with a means of sending attention messages to 			pass control information between the two communicating applications 			without disrupting the main flow of data.  						In most cases, ADSP is the protocol that Apple recommends applications 			use for sending and receiving data. In addition to ensuring reliable 			delivery of data, ADSP provides a peer-to-peer connection, that is, 			both ends of the connection can exert equal control over the exchange 			of data. 			From IM-Networking, page 1-13:			The AppleTalk Data Stream Protocol (ADSP) is a connection-oriented 			protocol that supports sessions over which applications and processes 			that are socket clients can exchange full-duplex streams of data across 			an AppleTalk internet. ADSP is a symmetrical protocol; the socket 			clients at either end of the connection have equal control over the 			ADSP session and the data exchange. Through attention messages, ADSP 			also provides for out-of-band signaling, a process of sending data 			outside the normal session dialog so as not to interrupt the data flow. 	From IM-Networking, page 5-4:			ADSP manages and controls the data flow between the two sockets 			throughout the session to ensure that:			-- the data is delivered and received in the order in which it was sent			-- duplicate data is not sent			-- the application or process at the receiving end of the connection has 			   the buffer capacity to accept the data	From IM-Networking, page 1-28:			If you write an application that uses one of the high-level AppleTalk 			protocols, such as ADSP or ATP, your program will run over any link type. 			A user running your application can switch between link types, for 			example, move from one type of network, such as token ring, to another, 			such as Ethernet, without affecting your program. 			*//*====================================================================================*//*	IMPORTANT NOTE ON CURRENT CODE	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	This code uses globals to store things like ref nums and stuff, so all of these	routines can only operate on one connection at a time.

It reads whatever data is available	up to readBufferSize bytes.  It returns the acutal number of bytes read, and	a flag indicating if there is more data to be read.  		If actualBytesRead is zero, and noMoreData is 1, then there was nothing to be	read and the routine returns noErr.		IMPORTANT NOTE (paraphrased from IM-Networking page 5-16):		If there is less data in the receive queue than the amount you specify with the 		readBufferSize parameter, the command does not complete execution until there 		is enough data available to satisfy the request. There are three exceptions 		to this rule: 		-  If the end-of-message bit in the ADSP packet header is set, the dspRead 		   command reads the data in the receive queue, returns the actual amount of data 		   read in the actualBytesRead parameter, and returns with the noMoreData parameter 		   set to 1. 		-  If you have closed the connection end before calling the dspRead routine 		   (that is, the connection is half open), the command reads whatever data is 		   available and returns the actual amount of data read in the actualBytesRead 		   parameter. 		-  If ADSP has closed the connection before you call the dspRead routine and 		   there is no data in the receive queue, the routine returns the noErr result 		   code with the actCount parameter set to 0 and the eom parameter set to 0.		   	So, in general, ReadData() will *NOT RETURN* unless:		(1) it fills up readBuffer by reading readBufferSize bytes, and noMoreData is 0		    (and there is still more data to be read in this message, so clear out readBuffer		    and call ReadData() again.)		or:		(2) is doesn't fill up readBuffer, but it reads the entire message and noMoreData is 1		or:		(3) there is no data to be read in the first place			So, it is a bad thing to call WriteData() with half a message, because the ReadData() on	the other end will hang until it gets the whole message, slowing things down	considerably.  Try to send whole messages at a time.  */OSErr ReadData(Ptr readBuffer, 			// buffer to fill			UInt16 readBufferSize,		// number of bytes we expect (i.e. size of read buffer)			UInt16 *actualBytesRead,	// returns number of bytes read this time (can be nil)			UInt8 *noMoreData)			// returns 1 if there is no more data to read (can be nil)										// (i.e. it's the end of this message){DSPParamBlock myDSPPB;		// our ADSP parameter block, defined in <ADSP.h>OSErr err = noErr;	// fill in these values first in case there is an error, the caller will know	// that he received no data	if (actualBytesRead)		*actualBytesRead = 0;	if (noMoreData)		*noMoreData = 1;#if SANITY_CHECKS	if (!gStartedNetwork)		return ERR_NETWORK_NOT_STARTED;	if (!gOpenedConnection)		return ERR_CONNECTION_NOT_OPENED;	if (readBuffer == nil)		return ERR_BOGUS_PARAMETER;#endif // SANITY_CHECKS	// check gMyCCB.state here to make sure we have an open connection	if (gMyCCB.state != sOpen)		return ERR_CONNECTION_NOT_OPENED;	// check gMyCCB.userFlags here to make sure we have an open connection	// if userFlags & eClosed, then the connection was just closed by remote connection	// theoretically we could still read, but this is stopgap measure (•DEBUG•)	if (gMyCCB.userFlags & eClosed)		return ERR_CONNECTION_NOT_OPENED;	// (7)	// Read Data 	// Use the dspRead routine to read data that your connection end has received from 	// the remote connection end. 		// issue a status call, and only read if there are bytes to be read	myDSPPB.ioCompletion = nil;							// no completion routine	myDSPPB.ioCRefNum = gADSPDrvrRefNum;				// ADSP driver ref num	myDSPPB.csCode = dspStatus;							// get connection status	myDSPPB.ccbRefNum = gCCBRefNum;						// connection ref num	err = PBControl((ParmBlkPtr)&myDSPPB, FALSE);		// get connection status	// use the PBControl err if there is one; otherwise use ioResult err code		if (err == noErr)		err = myDSPPB.ioResult;			// if there was an error, go to error	if (err != noErr)		goto ERROR;		// only issue a read call if there is data to be read 	if (myDSPPB.u.statusParams.recvQPending > 0)	{		myDSPPB.ioCompletion = nil;						// no completion routine		myDSPPB.ioCRefNum = gADSPDrvrRefNum;			// ADSP driver ref num		myDSPPB.csCode = dspRead;						// issue a read		myDSPPB.ccbRefNum = gCCBRefNum;					// connection ref num		myDSPPB.u.ioParams.reqCount = readBufferSize;	// read this number of bytes		myDSPPB.u.ioParams.dataPtr = readBuffer;		// pointer to read buffer		err = PBControl((ParmBlkPtr)&myDSPPB, FALSE);	// read data from the remote connection			// use the PBControl err if there is one; otherwise use ioResult err code			if (err == noErr)			err = myDSPPB.ioResult;				if (err != noErr)		{			if (actualBytesRead != nil)				*actualBytesRead = 0;			if (noMoreData != nil)				*noMoreData = 1;			goto ERROR;		}			if (actualBytesRead != nil)			*actualBytesRead = myDSPPB.u.ioParams.actCount;		if (noMoreData != nil)			*noMoreData = myDSPPB.u.ioParams.eom;	}	else	// no data to be read	{		// no bytes to be read, so fill in these values		if (actualBytesRead)			*actualBytesRead = 0;		if (noMoreData)			*noMoreData = 1;	}ERROR:		return err;}/*====================================================================================*//*	Routine to write data.  	This routine does not operate asychronously.
